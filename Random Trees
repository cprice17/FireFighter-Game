Random Tree 1

tree = rtree(n = sample(3:20, 1), tip.label = NULL, rooted = FALSE, equiprob = FALSE)
plot(tree, show.tip.label = FALSE)
nodelabels()
tiplabels()

# rooted can only be true or false and true = bifurcation and false= trifurcation
# equiprob is whether or not each brach has the name number of leafs
# I still need to figure out how to change the order in the numbering
