Random interconnected graphs with random number of vertices and random connections


nvert = sample(2:15, 1) # the 2 is so that there are 2 or more vertices and the 15 is random max of vertices that I picked
print(nvert)

edges = sample(1:nvert[1], nvert[1])
edges = c(edges, sample(1:nvert[1], nvert[1])) # This is what makes the interconnections between the vertices random

i =2
while(i<length(edges)){
edges = append(edges, edges[i], after = i)
i = i+2
} # This while loop connects them

ff1 = graph(edges, n = nvert[1], directed = F) # The F takes away the direction from the arrow although maybe we can explore that with fire
plot(ff1)
